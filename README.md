# Transformer_example

This is repo which implements a simple Transformer. It takes the attention mechanism and other network components that Andrej Karpathy developed in nanoGPT for language generation and reuse them to implement a Transformer for language translation. This uses the PyTorch framework. The language translation Transformer’s structure follows the example in François Chollet’s book ‘Deep Learning with Python'.
